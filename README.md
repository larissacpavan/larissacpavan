## 💻 Project

I participated in the Full-Stack Java Developer Bootcamp, where I worked in a team to develop *Projeto Igarapé*, a fictional e-commerce platform for sustainable products. We used Java, Spring Boot, MySQL, and Heroku for the back end; React, TypeScript, VS Code, and Vercel for the front end. This experience strengthened my expertise in full-stack web development.
